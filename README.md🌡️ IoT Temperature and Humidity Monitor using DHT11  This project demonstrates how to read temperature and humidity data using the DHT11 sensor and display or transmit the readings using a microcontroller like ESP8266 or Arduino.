🌡️IoT Temperature and Humidity Monitor using DHT11
In this project, demonstrates how to read temperature and humidity data, using the DHT11 sensor and display or transmit the readings using a microcontroller like ESP8266 or Arduino.

📌Project Overview
The system reads environmental temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor and displays the values on a serial monitor . It's suitable for beginners and can be extended to smart home or industrial monitoring systems.

🛠️Technologies & Tools
- Microcontroller: ESP8266 (NodeMCU) / Arduino Uno / ESP32  
- Sensor: DHT11 (Digital Temperature & Humidity Sensor)  
- Language: C / Embedded C (Arduino IDE)  
- Libraries: `DHT.h` for Arduino  
- IDE: Arduino IDE / PlatformIO (VS Code)  
- Display: Serial Monitor / OLED / LCD (optional)

Pin Diagram
DHT11 Pin     	Connection
VCC	            3.3V / 5V
DATA	          D2 (or GPIO4)
GND           	GND
You can use a 10K pull-up resistor between VCC and DATA pin for better signal stability.

🧾 Features
- Reads temperature and humidity from DHT11 sensor
- Displays data on serial monitor or OLED (optional)
- Can be extended to send data to cloud platforms like Firebase, Blynk, or Thingspeak
- Suitable for home automation, weather stations, and environment monitoring

🚀 Future Improvements
- Add OLED or LCD display
- Integrate with WiFi for remote monitoring
- Log data to Firebase or an SD card
- Add alerts using a buzzer or LED
